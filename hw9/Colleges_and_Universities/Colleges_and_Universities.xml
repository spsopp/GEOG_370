            <abstract>The Colleges and Universities dataset is composed of any type of Post Secondary Education such as: colleges, universities, technical schools, trade schools, business schools, satellite (branch) campuses, etc. that grant First Professional, Associate, Bachelors, Masters, or Doctoral degrees.    Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results.    All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.    The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute, the oldest record dates from 07/09/2007 and the newest record dates from 07/26/2007.</abstract>
            <purpose>Homeland Security

Use Cases: Use cases help define and clarify requirements, and describe how the data may be used.

1) Identification of populations that may need to be evacuated in the event of an emergency.

2) Notification of groups of people who may be at risk from a contagious disease outbreak.</purpose>

TGS Processing
&gt;
&gt;1) Verified name, physical address, and phone numbers by contacting the entity or an authority responsible for the entity.
&gt;
&gt;2) Determined or verified the geospatial location for the entity through contact with entity or authority responsible for entity. Entities were asked to describe their geospatial location relative to land marks visible in ortho imagery.
&gt;
&gt;3) All text fields were set to upper case.
&gt;
&gt;4) Leading and trailing spaces were trimmed from all text fields. These spaces can interfere with some database queries.
&gt;
&gt;5) Non printable and diacritic characters were removed from all text fields. These values have been found to prevent data from being loaded into some spatial database engines.

                <attrlabl>CITY</attrlabl>
                <attrdef>
The name of the city associated with the entity's physical address. For physical addresses that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) delivers to, this should be a "city" acceptable to the USPS as defined in their Address Information System (AIS). Sometimes the USPS does not deliver mail to a physical address but recognizes the location (i.e., they list the location as "undeliverable"). The cities associated with these locations are acceptable. In some cases, the USPS does not recognize individual physical addresses in a city, rather, they list the city as having "General Delivery". In these cases, the city and associated zip code are acceptable (the entity's [ADDRESS] attribute will contain a street address, not "general delivery"). The entity may not actually be located within the city limits of the "city" specified in its city field. Instead, it may actually be located within the city limits of another city. In some cases, the "city" that appears in this attribute may not even be a city in an administrative sense, but it is still an acceptable "city" to the USPS. An example of this is "Notre Dame, IN". There is no city in Indiana called "Notre Dame", but this is considered an acceptable city by the USPS for any delivery going to the University of Notre Dame which is actually located in the city of South Bend. "Notre Dame", like most USPS cities, is an easily recognized place, and it gives the user of the data a good general idea of where the entity is located (if the entity is located in a small municipality, the USPS "city" may be more recognizable than the name of the municipality), and it would be part of the address one would use to send a shipment to the entity's location. Using the USPS acceptable "city" also allows someone to do a logical consistency check between the zip code and the city by using the USPS AIS.

Sometimes an entity may report a city that is not accepted by the USPS, and although TGS has tried to replace those cities with an acceptable alternative, some of them may remain in this dataset.

NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) Description for entity. The "Index Entries" that appear on the NAICS webpage (http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html) are being used to populate this attribute as opposed to the "NAICS Title". While there is a one to one correspondence between NAICS Codes and "NAICS Titles", there is a one to many relationship between NAICS Codes and the "Index Entries". By using the "Index Entries", we have placed the entities that make up this layer into more specific categories; however, the user of this data should be aware that this was not the intended purpose of these "Index Entries". The "Index Entries" were intended as a way to search the NAICS database and as a way of enumerating ways in which establishments falling under the given NAICS Code may be named. Thus, there are often two or more "Index Entries" that are synonyms, for example: "Prisons" and "Penitentiaries". In cases like this, we have standardized on one "Index Entry".

NAICS Descriptions (and NAICS Codes) have been assigned based upon the entity's primary function, regardless of the function that qualified it to be included in this dataset.
